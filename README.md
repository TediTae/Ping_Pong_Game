# Pong Game üèì

## Description
A classic Pong game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics module.
The game features two paddles controlled by players on the left and right sides of the screen, and a ball that bounces between them.
The goal is to prevent the ball from passing your paddle while trying to score against the opponent.

## Features
- Two-player gameplay:  
  - Right paddle controlled by **Up** and **Down** arrow keys  
  - Left paddle controlled by **W** and **S** keys  
- Ball movement with realistic bouncing off walls and paddles  
- Score tracking displayed on the screen  
- Smooth animation with Turtle's `tracer` and `update` functions  
- Modular code using classes for Ball, Paddle, and Scoreboard

## Project Structure
- `main.py`: Main game loop and event handling  
- `paddle.py`: Paddle class controlling paddle behavior and movement  
- `ball.py`: Ball class controlling ball movement and collision  
- `scoreboard.py`: Scoreboard class managing score display and updates

## How to Play
1. Run the game with `python main.py`.  
2. Control the right paddle with the **Up** and **Down** arrow keys.  
3. Control the left paddle with the **W** (up) and **S** (down) keys.  
4. Prevent the ball from passing your paddle to avoid conceding points.  
5. The game continues indefinitely, keeping score of each player's points.
